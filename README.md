# cra-template-gf

Custom cra template curated by [your's truly](https://github.com/gfilippou), expanding upon the official TypeScript template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Why

When setting up quick React projects, I repeated the same setup steps, so I made this template for **DRY** and time-saving.

### Incuded

- TypeScript
- Jest, React Testring Library
- Chakra UI, custom provider & theme
- [Inter Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
- Error Boundary component
- Custom error logging component

## Usage

### Installation

To use this template, add `--template gf` when creating a new app:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template gf
```

```
yarn create react-app my-app --template gf
```

### Update

You can also run:

```
npm outdated
```

to check for any outdated packages and afterwards selectively update the ones you want, or:

```
npm update
```

to automatically update every package at your own risk, as this can potentially result to incompatibility issues.

For more information, refer to the official [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) docs.
